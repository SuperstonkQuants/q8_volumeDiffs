Propose your question or request
I want to investigate the differences in volume (ideally as percentage of float or shares issued) between GME, the other "meme stocks" as identified by the media such as AMC, BB, BBBY, and boomer stocks such as GE. I'm interested because AMC and GME have similar movements but AMC trades daily volume equal to ~100%+ shares issued , and GME trades on daily volume ~10% of shares issued. I believe being familiar with the volumes traded regularly will help to identify key differences between GME and other memestocks and identify when the MOASS really begins.

To do this, I need the price and volume data for GME, the meme stocks, and some random boomer stocks as a control.

Describe alternatives you've considered
I wanted to work on some of these questions (https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nr2gbi/hank_needs_you_part_ii_hank_the_data_shepherd/) but didn't the time to dedicate last week. The community answered them really remarkably quickly.

Additional context
I am a researcher in the physical sciences. I am comfortable with Python and data analysis techniques but new to financial markets and don't have any data to work with. If I can keep up with the Ape quant team in terms of technical skills I would like to help out with additional projects.
